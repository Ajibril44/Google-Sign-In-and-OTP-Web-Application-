1. Introduction
Overview of the Task
The task involved creating a PHP web application that allows users to sign in using their Google account and obtain a one-time password (OTP) after successful authentication. The primary goal was to implement a seamless and secure authentication process, coupled with a visually appealing user interface.
Purpose of the Application
The application serves as a secure and user-friendly authentication system. By leveraging Google Sign-In, users can conveniently log in with their Google credentials and receive a one-time password for enhanced security.
2. Implementation Details
Frontend Components
The frontend components were implemented using HTML, JavaScript (Google Sign-In API), and CSS. The "Sign In with Google" button was incorporated into a clean and intuitive user interface. The application's layout and styling were designed to provide an engaging and user-friendly experience.
Backend Components
On the backend, PHP was used to handle server-side logic. The auth.php file manages the processing of Google authentication data, OTP generation, and error handling. The server communicates with the frontend through asynchronous JSON-based requests.
Technology Stack
The technology stack comprises HTML, JavaScript (Google Sign-In API), PHP, and CSS. This combination of technologies ensures a robust and efficient implementation of the authentication system.
3. Google Sign-In Functionality
Implementation Details
The Google Sign-In functionality was achieved by integrating the Google Sign-In API. Upon clicking the "Sign In with Google" button, users are redirected to Google's authentication page. After successful authentication, the user's email address is retrieved and displayed on the UI.
User Authentication Flow
Click "Sign In with Google": Initiates the Google Sign-In process.
Google Authentication Page: Redirects the user to Google's authentication page.
User Grants Permission: The user grants permission for the application to access their Google account.
Email Retrieval: Upon successful authentication, the user's email address is retrieved.
Display Email: The retrieved email address is displayed on the UI.
4. OTP Generation and Display
OTP Generation Logic
After successful authentication, a one-time password (OTP) is generated using the generateOTP function in the auth.php file. The current implementation utilizes the random_bytes function to generate a secure and random OTP. This OTP is then sent to the frontend for display.
Display Mechanism
The OTP is displayed in the otp-container on the UI, enhancing visibility and accessibility. The user is informed that the OTP will be visible for a limited time, promoting a time-sensitive security measure.
Visibility Duration
To enhance security, the OTP is visible for 30 seconds before it automatically disappears from the UI. This feature ensures that the OTP is not accessible to unauthorized individuals after the specified time period.
5. Error Handling
Scenarios Covered
Proper error handling has been implemented to address scenarios such as failed Google authentication or OTP generation. This ensures a smooth and secure user experience, even when unexpected issues arise.
Meaningful Error Messages
Meaningful error messages are displayed to the user in case of any issues during the sign-in process. These messages provide clear information about the nature of the problem and guide the user on potential solutions.
6. User Interface Design
Styling Choices
The user interface was designed with simplicity and aesthetics in mind. The choice of colors, layout, and typography aims to create a visually appealing and user-friendly environment. The color scheme provides a pleasant contrast, and the rounded corners of the containers add a touch of modernity.

Personalization
A personalized touch was added to the UI by including a welcome message with the UltaInfinity Global Group name, "UltaInfinity." This small but meaningful addition enhances the user experience and adds a sense of familiarity.
7. Conclusion
Summary of Achievements
The implemented web application successfully achieves the goal of providing a secure and user-friendly authentication system. Google Sign-In integration, OTP generation, and error handling contribute to a robust and reliable user experience.
Future Enhancements
Potential future enhancements may include additional security measures, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), and further improvements to the user interface for an even more polished appearance.
